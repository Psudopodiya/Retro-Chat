## Cloning the Repo with Submodules

Since this repository contains submodules, you need to clone the repository with the `--recurse-submodules` flag to ensure that the submodules are cloned properly. Follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repo with submodules**:

   ```bash
   git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
   ```

2. **Navigate into the project folder**:

   ```bash
   cd your-repo
   ```

3. **If you forgot to clone with the `--recurse-submodules` flag**, you can initialize and update the submodules manually:

   ```bash
   git submodule update --init --recursive
   ```

4. **Pull changes for submodules when updating**:
   When pulling updates, make sure to also update the submodules with:

   ```bash
   git pull --recurse-submodules
   ```

## Running the Entire Application

To run the application, follow the setup steps for both the **backend** and **frontend** as described in their respective READMEs.

### 1. Running the Backend:

Before executing any scripts, ensure the scripts are executable in the terminal.

**Step 1**: Navigate to the backend directory:

```bash
cd backend
```

**Step 2**: Make the scripts executable:

```bash
chmod +x ./scripts/*.sh
```

**Step 3**: Build the Docker image:

```bash
./scripts/build.sh
```

**Step 4**: Start the application:

```bash
./scripts/run.sh
```

**Step 5**: Migrate the database (run this when starting for the first time or after any changes to models) :
Run this in a different terminal and make sure the container are running

```bash
./scripts/migrate.sh
```

The backend will be accessible at:

- Web Application: [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)
- Admin Interface: [http://localhost:8001/admin](http://localhost:8001/admin)

### 2. Running the Frontend

**Step 1**: Navigate to the frontend directory:

```bash
cd frontend
```

**Step 2**: Install the required dependencies:
